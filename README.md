#project connect_four

objective: this is a virtual version of the classic connect four game.

functionality:
              
              -this is a connect_four game and 'q' will quit the game and 'r' will show the replay.

              -in replay, the program would show an empty board and make the moves exactly like the user made. 
              
              -the user again gets an option for 'q' or 'r'.
              
              -the moves the the user made in the connect_four game would be recorded using a linked list.
              
              -the code for the linked list working is in (slist.c) while the main game code is in (connect.c)
              
              -the header file (slist.h)
